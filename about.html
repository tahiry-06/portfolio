              You're more than who you think you are â€” you're a story waiting to be told, a vision ready to be brought
              to life. I believe creativity has the power to make people feel seen, understood, and truly special.
              That's why I don't just design, develop, or create â€” I craft experiences that reflect who you are and what
              makes you unique. With a blend of front-end development, graphic design, photography, and sound
              production, I transform ideas into visually stunning and emotionally compelling creations.
              <!-- Every project is a
              collaboration, ensuring that what we build together isn't just beautiful but deeply meaningful. What you get
              isn't just a design or a service â€” it's a masterpiece that speaks for you, inspires others, and sets you
              apart. Let's create something that's unmistakably you. -->

              Because honesty is the cornerstone of trust and respect, I would like to introduce you to my educational
              background with complete transparency. Coming from a modest family, I couldn't afford to study at an IT
              university back in the day. So I decided I was smart enough to teach myself all the subjects and topics
              that exist in the IT realm. It turned out to be a completely different universe from what we learned in
              college. I don't have any certificates like a PhD or a master's degree or even the most insignificant
              certificate from university, but I will try to add something to make my website look good. I am really
              proud of what I have achieved so far and I am looking forward to learning more.

                  <em>"Yes, I do"</em> most of you will say and just start presenting yourself like... hey, I am Maria
                  (lovely name by the way) and I do such job, I live at some place. Yes, those can indeed answer to the
                  question but for me, I guess I will start with something else. I always struggle to figure out what to
                  write in this section because I don't really know how to tell people about myself. Most of the time, I
                  let them figure out who I am. However, I'll try to give you a glimpse.

                  I am a simple person who likes adventure â€” after all, who doesn't? I am grateful for the wise, grown
                  adventurer that I have become. It's been a quarter of a century now that I have been an adventurer,
                  and I feel like there is still so much to discover and learn. I always prioritize peace over anything
                  else, and maybe that has made me the conservative person I am today. I am naturally curious and always
                  try to experience something new every day. I love reading books and deciphering the secrets they hold.

                  I am grateful that I grew up with a guitar, too. That really helped me channel some useless emotions.
                  In fact, trying to impress that girl was the main reason I pushed myself to learn it. Funny enough, it
                  was the first self-taught skill I ever learned. Anyway, I love feeding my brain with new knowledge,
                  and I am always eager to learn.

                  I love talking to old people because they are like living history. They have so much to teach, and I
                  have so much to learn and listen to â€” so that someday, I too can tell beautiful stories to hungry
                  adventurers like me.

                  I could not fit everything about me in this section, but I hope you have a glimpse of who I am. I am
                  looking forward to knowing you, too. If you have any questions, feel free to say hello and ask!
